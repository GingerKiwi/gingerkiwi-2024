### Finish UI Design, Work on Command Line Skills, and Diving Back Into Javascript!

This is a daily record of my second iteration of 100 Days of Code. This time I'm (usually) doing 5 days a week instead of 7. This is week 05 of 20 weeks.  I finished the Scrimba UI Design course, started Wes Bos' Command Line and Flexbox courses, and spent sometime in my Exploring CSS Layouts repo. I also dived back into Javascript on Thursday reviewing constructor functions, methods and Object.assign(). On Friday I updated the design and deployed my Yarn Help! project to my own domain at https://yarnhelp.app. Finally on Saturday I worked extensively on the Docs, including plans for future expansion.


#### Day 120  |  2023-03-13  |   Monday  | Focus: UI Design  |  

Main Resource: Scrimba UI Design Course https://scrimba.com/learn/designbootcamp

Completed: 
1) Finished UI Animations  
2) Started final UI Design Course project - to "Defining the Hero Section CSS part 2"

Refection: The animations module wasn't anything new. It was just a colour transform on a single button. I'll need to delve into this deeper at some point.
I love design and css, but I'm getting bored; it's time to delve into Javascript again!
I really want to apply all this and upskill my Javascript for yarnhelp.app


#### Day 121  |  2023-03-13  |   Tuesday  | Focus: UI Design  & Command Line |  

Main Resources: 
1) [Scrimba UI Design Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/designbootcamp)
2) [Wes Bos' Command Line Power User course](http://commandlinepoweruser.com/)
	1) [OhMyZSH Framework](https://ohmyz.sh/)
	2) [OhMyZSH Themes GitHub repo](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes)
	3) [PIP Documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

Completed: 
1) ** Finished UI Design Course!**
2) Started [Wes Bos' Command Line Power User course](http://commandlinepoweruser.com/)

UI Design Course Certificate
<img src="/assets/blog/2023.03-14_UI-Design-Cert_Scrimba.png" alt="ALT!" class="img-smaller">

Refections and Notes for UI Design: Can do css descendent selectors 3 deep not just two deep like this:
```css
/* to target a image(s) inside of an li inside of a list */
ul.features li img {
	width: 40px;
}
```

To make an svg into a watermark:
```css
.fern {
	position: absolute;
	bottom: 0;
	left: 0;
	z-index: 1;
	width: 80%;
	opacity: .1;
}
```

To have three items in a media query (eg small tablet) align with two on top and one centred below:
<img src="/assets/blog/Screen Shot 2023-03-14 at 11.38.39 AM.png" alt="screenshot of a section of a web page showing two items on top with one on the bottom. Each item has a medium green icon with a small paragraph of lorem ipsum placeholder text below in white sans-serif font. all items are centred." class="img-smaller">
	 
```css
.featured-cabins, 
.features, 
.testimonials /* testimonials fits well three items across so there's no need to apply the li:last-child rules below */
				{
	display: grid;
	grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(min(120px, 100%), 1fr));
	grid-gap: 1rem;
	justify-content: space-evenly;
}

/* Just using .features:last-child doesn't work because we're looking for the last li not the last .features */
.featured-cabins li:last-child,
.features li:last-child
{
	grid-column: 1 / span 2;
	max-width: 50%;
	justify-self: center;
}
/* Note: .testimonials fits well three items across so there's no need to apply the li:last-child rules above */
```
- At some point I should review/get more into GSAP GreenSock Animation Platform: https://greensock.com/get-started/

Reflections and Notes for Command Line Course:
- OhMy zsh is a lifesaver!
	- This along with sudo was how I could open the .zshrc file and get around the "permission denied" issue in MacOS.
- Apparently I have Python 3.8.3 installed. (Current release is 3.11.1)
- #UI-design-ideas the https://ohmyz.sh/ site has a nice colour animation on the themes icon. :-)

#### Day 122  |  2023-03-15  |   Wednesday  | Focus: Flexbox  |  

Main Resources:
1) [WesBos What the Flexbox Course](https://flexbox.io/)
2) My Exploring CSS Layouts repo

Completed: 
1) What the Flexbox to video 11 of 20: *"Finally understanding Flexbox flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis" ** 
2) Added a flexbox page and .css to repo

Refection: Tired today, but this I can do.
Need to fix the github issues with my repo.
Could use the grid page as a starting point for yarnhelp.app

#### Day 123  |  2023-03-16  |   Thursday  | Focus: Javascript - Review Constructor Functions & Methods  |  

Main Resources:
1) Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path Module: [Next Level Javascript](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend)
2) Referring back to the existing [yarnhelp github repo](https://github.com/GingerKiwi/yarn-gift-help-1.0/blob/main/app.js) to see how/if I can apply this to any parts of the short or medium term plans for the site - and actually getting it live on yarnhelp.app

Completed: 
1) Frontend Developer Career Path - Next Level Javascript up to [Object.assign()](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend/aside-objectassign-cyek7bsG)

Refections and Notes: 
- Variable names: This is why I've always used "01" instead of just "1" for numbers. I spent 20minutes trying to see what I was missing/had forgotten about constructor functions with the code below. ... Only to finally figure out that "hotel1" was misspelled "hote1".

```js
// Code and challenge provided on Scrimba
const hotel1 = {
    name: 'Safari View',
    rooms: 30,
    stars: '⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐',
    costPerNightAdult: 240,
}  

const hotel2 = {
    name: 'Leopard Mansion',
    rooms: 96,
    stars: '⭐⭐⭐',
    costPerNightAdult: 120,
}

/*

Challenge:
1. Create a constructor function called NationalParkHotels.
2. Have it take in "data" as a parameter
3. Assign the data to "this"
4. Log out the result of creating an instance of
NationalParkHotels for each hotel.
*/
 ```

```js
// Code and console output with spelling error:
function NationalParkHotels(data){
	this.name = data.name
	this.rooms = data.rooms
	this.stars = data.stars
	this.costPerNightAdult = data.costPerNightAdult
}  

const safariView = new NationalParkHotels(hote1)
const leopardMansion = new NationalParkHotels(hotel2)
    

console.log(safariView)
// console output 
ReferenceError: hote1 is not defined (/index.js:22)
```

```js
// Code and console output after fixing spelling error:
function NationalParkHotels(data){
	this.name = data.name
	this.rooms = data.rooms
	this.stars = data.stars
	this.costPerNightAdult = data.costPerNightAdult
}  

const safariView = new NationalParkHotels(hotel1)
const leopardMansion = new NationalParkHotels(hotel2)
    

console.log(safariView)
console.log(leopardMansion)

// console output after fixing spelling error:
NationalParkHotels {name:"Safari View", rooms:30, stars:"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐", costPerNightAdult:240}

NationalParkHotels {name:"Leopard Mansion", rooms:96, stars:"⭐⭐⭐", costPerNightAdult:120}

```

Methods on a Constructor Function Example

```js
function NationalParkHotels(data){
	this.name = data.name
	this.rooms = data.rooms
	this.stars = data.stars
	this.costPerNightAdult = data.costPerNightAdult
	this.costPerNightChild = data.costPerNightChild
	this.summariseHotel = function(){
	        console.log(`A one night stay
	at the ${this.name}for two adults and two children costs a
	total of $${2*(this.costPerNightAdult)+2*(this.costPerNightChild)}.`)

    }
}
  
const safariView = new NationalParkHotels(hotel1)
const lepoardMansion = new NationalParkHotels(hotel2) 

safariView.summariseHotel()
lepoardMansion.summariseHotel()
```

```js
// Another way of doing this is to use a variable for the totalPrice
this.summariseHotel = function(){        
	const totalPrice = this.costPerNightAdult * 2 + this.costPerNightChild * 2        
	console.log(`A one night stay at the ${this.name} for two adults and two children costs a total of $${totalPrice}.`)

    }
```

```js
// Object.assign(target, source)
const sandraKayeProfileData = {
    name: 'Sandra Kaye',
    portfolio: 'www.sandrasportfolio.com',
    currentJob: 'Google',
    currentSalary: '400k'   
}

function DevProfile(data){
	Object.assign(this, data)
	    this.name = data.name
	    this.portfolio = data.portfolio
	    this.currentJob = data.currentJob
	    this.currentSalary = data.currentSalary
	    this.summariseDev = function(){
	    console.log(`${this.name}'s porfolio is at ${this.portfolio} and they work at ${this.currentJob}. Their current salary is ${this.currentSalary}.`)
	}
}  
  
/*
Challenge
1. Use Object.assign to cut 4 lines of code from the constructor function.
*/
    
function DevProfile(data){
	Object.assign(this, data)
	    this.summariseDev = function(){
	    console.log(`${this.name}'s porfolio is at ${this.portfolio} and they work at ${this.currentJob}. Their current salary is ${this.currentSalary}.`)
	}
}  

const sandraKaye = new DevProfile(sandraKayeProfileData)
sandraKaye.summariseDev()

// Console output:
// Sandra Kaye's porfolio is at www.sandrasportfolio.com and they work at Google. Their current salary is 400k.
```

#### Day 124  |  2023-03-17  |   Friday  | Focus:  YarnHelp.app - deploying and redesign  |  

Main Resources:
n/a

Completed: 
1) See changelog on github repo for dev branch [https://github.com/GingerKiwi/yarnhelp/tree/Dev-2023.03](https://github.com/GingerKiwi/yarnhelp/tree/Dev-2023.03)
2) Woke up at 7am - kept coding until 1pm. It's a flow day!

Refections and Notes: 
- Need to refactor to use variables instead of calculations inside string literals for results.

#### Day 154  |  2023-03-18  |   Friday  | Focus:  YarnHelp.app - Docs | 

Main Resources:
n/a

Completed: See copy of change log entry from today
### Work on Docs and Calculations
- Figured out that for **just the sweater calculations the app will need to do 200 calculations** for knit and crochet cardigans in 5 weights of yarn, for 6 sizes including oversized/long, cabled, and cabled cardigans.
	- Is it better to pull some of this data (eg total yardage per each project type/size) from a JSON doc?

- -> Goal is to do the calculations as variables outside of the string literals. The calculations are currently done inside the .innerHTML = statements like below:

```js
babyPulloverAnswer.innerHTML =

`You need ${Number(Math.ceil(550 * 1.05/yardsPerBall.value))} balls of this yarn for a baby pullover`
```

Instead something like this:
```js
// Worsted Weight (Craft Yarn Council yarn weight 4) for Baby Pullover:
const babyPulloverW4 = Number(Math.ceil(550 * 1.05/yardsPerBall.value))

babyPulloverAnswer.innerHTML = `${babyPulloverW4} balls of this yarn are needed for a baby pullover`
```
- Add PDF-References Folder to YarnHelp-Docs Folder
	- 2 webpages saved as pdf
		- Interweave Knits - sweater calculations
		- Twisted Yarn Shop - inc crochet, blankets/throws, scarfs, shawls, and accessories
	- Craft Yarn Council's Yarn Standards docs
- Add Calculations.md
	- Start list of yarn requirements for different weights of pullovers and cardigans
	- Start list of yarn requirements for blankets and throws
	- Add example of calculation in js code block
