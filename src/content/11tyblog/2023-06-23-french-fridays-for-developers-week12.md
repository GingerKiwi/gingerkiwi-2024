In March, 2023  started French for Devs Fridays to celebrate getting to 400 days on Duolingo. Here you'll find weekly useful and/or amusing French phrases for developers. This one's for all my fellow javascript developers and members of [Andrew Clarkson's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewtclarkson/) [Andrew's Coffee Chats](https://www.linkedin.com/company/andrews-coffee-chats/) discord server. It's slightly Star Wars inspired - but with chaos instead of the Force.

Today is my:
- 🇫🇷 **514th day of French**, 
- 🇳🇱 174th day of Dutch, 
- 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 13th day of Welsh, (I got curious and started another language last week!)
  and 
- 👋 51st Day of ASL (American Sign Language)

Here's this week's French for Devs quote and translation. It's from [Travis B.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/travis-b-34a618236/) in Andrew Clarkson's Coffee Chat's discord earlier this month. Published with Travis' permission.

Week 12 - June 23, 2023

English:  

"I do write Javascript! One must become one with the chaos to write Javascript"
