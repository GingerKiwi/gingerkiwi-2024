To celebrate getting to 400 days on Duolingo French at the beginning of March, 2023 I've started French for Devs Fridays. Here you'll find weekly useful and/or amusing French phrases for developers. 
Today is my 465th day of French and 125th day of Dutch!

Week 05 - March 30, 2023:

>"Si le débogage est le processus de suppression des bogues logiciels, alors la programmation doit être le processus de les insérer"
>~ Edsger Dijkstra

English:  
“If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in”

– Edsger Dijkstra
