In March, 2023  started French for Devs Fridays to celebrate getting to 400 days on Duolingo. Here you'll find weekly useful and/or amusing French phrases for developers. This one is for all my fellow devs who are also doing DSA/technical interview prep.

Today is my:
- 🇫🇷 **588th day of French**, 
- 🇳🇱 247th day of Dutch, 
- 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 86th day of Welsh, 
- 🇩🇪 8th day of German,
- 🇳🇴 2nd day of Norwegian,

Here's this week's French for Devs quote and translation. I was reading Apple news and came across a brilliantly worded article by Tristian Cross of The Guardian. A link to his article is below.
