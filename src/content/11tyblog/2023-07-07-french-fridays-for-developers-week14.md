In March, 2023  started French for Devs Fridays to celebrate getting to 400 days on Duolingo. Here you'll find weekly useful and/or amusing French phrases for developers. This one's for all my fellow devs who also like to learn by breaking our code first.

Today is my:
- 🇫🇷 **528th day of French**, 
- 🇳🇱 188th day of Dutch, 
- 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 28th day of Welsh,
  and
