In March, 2023  started French for Devs Fridays to celebrate getting to 400 days on Duolingo. Here you'll find weekly useful and/or amusing French phrases for developers. This one's for all those new devs learning to code for the first time, current devs diving into a completely new language far removed from your usual stack, or anyone who's tried to explain code to non-programmers and gotten "that look".

Today is my:
- 🇫🇷 **507 day of French**, 
- 🇳🇱 **167th day of Dutch**, 
- 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 **6th day of Welsh, 
	- (I got curious and started another language this week!) and 
- 👋 **42nd Day of ASL (American Sign Language)**

Here's this week's French for Devs quote and translation. I was reading Apple news and came across a brilliantly worded article by Tristian Cross of The Guardian. A link to his article is below.

How non-programmers see code:
*"Code can appear alarming to the uninitiated: inscrutable “languages” that mostly read like a calculator having a stroke”*
