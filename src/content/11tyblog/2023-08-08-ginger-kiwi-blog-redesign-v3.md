  It's almost time for yet another update to the Ginger Kiwi blog design. There's a semantic issue with a lot of the headings, I'd like separate pages for articles with different themes, and a dark mode. For now my focus is The Alice in Wonderland Project and job applications,

<h3>Planned Updates for Fall 2023</h3>
<p>It's almost time for yet another update to the Ginger Kiwi blog design. Right now I'm working on my dev portfolio site (<a href="http://gingerkiwi.dev target="_blank"">http://gingerkiwi.dev</a>), <a href="https://yarnhelp3.netlify.app/ target="_blank"">Yarn Help! 3.0</a> , plus a bit of work every week on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/alice-in-wonderland-project target="_blank"">The Alice in Wonderland Project</a>.</p>

<p>Version 3.0 of this blog will include:</p>

<ul>

<li>Update the image style for snippets.</li>

<li>Image assets: Better organization and file size optimization.</li>

<li>Dedicated pages for different topics with cards linking to each one on the home page.</li>

<li>A drafts folder inside the repo using a "draft" tag. Then all I have to do to publish an article is remove the tag and move the markdown file from the /drafts to the /blog folder. I've been keeping the drafts in a separate Obsidian vault from the one for this repo.</li>

<li>Dark and light theme toggle.</li>

<li>Fixing the issue with the heading levels so article titles are h2 or h3 on the home page and h1 on the individual article pages.</li>

<li>Updated design for the home page with more of a card format.</li>

<li>Mobile first.</li>

<li>Updated design for the article pages.</li>

<li>Including "skip to main content" and "prefers reduced motion" functions.</li>

<li>Add captions to images so those using OS built in text-to-speech can hear the alt text descriptions. MacOS screenreader doesn't read alt text. It just reads what the user can see.</li>

<li>Possibly creating a custom Prism.js theme for both the site and the <a href="https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes target="_blank"">Prism.js Open Source project.</a></li>

</ul>
