In March, 2023 I started French for Devs Fridays to celebrate getting to 400 days on Duolingo. Today marks 643 days! Here you'll find weekly useful and/or amusing French phrases for developers. 

This week's quote is accessibility related. Most developers have had issues implementing accessibility. Ben Myers captured this perfectly with a phrase he used in his recent article ["Lost in Translation: Tips for Multilingual Web Accessibility"](https://benmyers.dev/blog/multilingual-web-accessibility/#bienvenue)when mentioning Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

See the links to WCAG documentation in English and French below if you're curious.

Today is my:
- 🇫🇷 **657th day of French**, 
- 🇳🇱 316th day of Dutch, 
- 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 155th day of Welsh, 
- 🇩🇪 77th day of German,
- 🇳🇴 71st day of Norwegian,

Here's this week's French for Devs quote and translation. 

Semaine 19, 29 septembre 2023

>*«<em><u>Pour ceux qui jouent au WCAG Bingo à la maison</em></u>, spécifier la langue principale de la page avec <html lang> est à peu près la technique pour répondre au critère de réussite 3.1.1 : Langue de la page, qui est une exigence de niveau A.»* <br>

English:  French for Devs #019, November 17, 2023

*"<em><u>For those playing WCAG Bingo at home</u></em>, specifying the page's primary language with `<html lang>` is pretty much _the_ technique for meeting [Success Criterion 3.1.1: Language of Page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/language-of-page.html), which is a Level A requirement."<br>

Here's the WCAG Documentation Links:

- [English WCAG 2.2 - 3.1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#language-of-page)
- [French WCAG 2.1 3.1.1](https://www.w3.org/Translations/WCAG21-fr/#language-of-page) There's no translations yet for 2.2 because they were just released.

Note: Yes, it's ironic that this site doesn't have the language set to French for all the French for Devs posts. That's one of the many accessibility, design, and functionality issues I'm currently fixing with my new combined blog and dev portfolio. It's temporarily at: [https://gingerkiwi.xyz](https://gingerkiwi.xyz).
