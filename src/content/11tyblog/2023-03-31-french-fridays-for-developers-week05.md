To celebrate getting to 400 days on Duolingo French at the beginning of March, 2023 I've started French for Devs Fridays. Here you'll find weekly useful and/or amusing French phrases for developers. 
Today is my 430th day of French and 90th day of Dutch!

Week 05 - March 30, 2023:

>*Mon chat a renversé mon café sur mon clavier!*

English:  
*My cat spilled my coffee on my keyboard!**

It's a special cat week in my home. **It's Kitten's 16th birthday tomorrow!**  He's a good boy and has never spilled coffee on my keyboard.

 Fifteen years ago he arrived for "just two weeks" on April Fools Day as an emergency foster from a kill shelter. Huge foster fail! Kitten made me a crazy cat lady. Over the years we've had seven rescue cats including Kitten. Now there's Kitten (16 tomorrow!), Boo (10 years old), and Maybel (almost 6 years old).
