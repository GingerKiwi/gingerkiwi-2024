In March, 2023 I started French for Devs Fridays to celebrate getting to 400 days on Duolingo. Today marks 643 days! Here you'll find weekly useful and/or amusing French phrases for developers. 

Today's quote is a day late. On Thursday [Toronto JavaScript](https://torontojs.com) had a tech talk at VM Ware Tazu Labs and a bunch of us went to the [Firkin on Yonge](https://www.firkinpubs.com/firkinonyonge/) at Queen Street afterwards. We had a great time! I got home after 3am. 

This week's quote is debugging related. While working on the new combined Ginger Kiwi blog and .dev portfolio site in Astro with Lazar Nikolov's [Astro course](https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-full-stack-blog-with-astro-7ffcf9ec) on Egghead.io a bug popped right during 'npm build dev'. Thanks to Lazar and Dreyfus on the [Creatures.dev](https://creatures.dev) discord for sorting it out! 

See the code block below if you're curious.

Today is my:
- 🇫🇷 **651st day of French**, 
- 🇳🇱 310th day of Dutch, 
- 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 149th day of Welsh, 
- 🇩🇪 71st day of German,
- 🇳🇴 65th day of Norwegian,

Here's this week's French for Devs quote and translation.

```ts
%% Initial code %%

const page: Page<CollectionEntry<'blog'>> = Astro.props.page;

%% Code that works %%

type Props = {
  page: Page<CollectionEntry<'blog'>>;
};

const { page } = Astro.props;

**I highly recommend The Firkin on Yonge for events!**
- There's a semi-private upstairs with choice of lounge style seating, 
- The staff are great, 
- They've handled the two [A11yTO](https://a11yto.com/) events after parties I've volunteered at well.
- It's wheelchair accessible with an elevator and an accessible washroom stall.
- It's centrally located, right near an accessible subway station (Queen), and just two stops from Union station for people coming in from out of town.
