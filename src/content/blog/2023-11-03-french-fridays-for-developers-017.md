In March, 2023 I started French for Devs Fridays to celebrate getting to 400 days on Duolingo. Today marks 643 days! Here you'll find weekly useful and/or amusing French phrases for developers. 

Today's quote is cybersecurity related - because both the Toronto Public Library and the British Library have been victims of ransomware attacks. All us devs in Toronto and anyone else that were using O'Reilly eBooks through TPL for professional development and reference have been out of luck since last weekend.

Today is my:
- 🇫🇷 **643rd day of French**, 
- 🇳🇱 302nd day of Dutch, 
- 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 141st day of Welsh, 
- 🇩🇪 63rd day of German,
- 🇳🇴 57th day of Norwegian,

Here's this week's French for Devs quote and translation.
