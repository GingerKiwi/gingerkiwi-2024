Have you ever wondered how to get certified as a web accessibility specialist? 
Here's a quick article giving an introduction to web accessibility certification and several ways to prepare for it.

## Two Certification Routes

There's two industry standard routes to being certified in web accessibility. The first is Certified Professional in Web Accessibility (CPWA) by International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP). The second is Section 508 Trusted Tester certification by United States Homeland Security (USHS).

### IAAP Certified Professional in Web Accessibility.

The Certified Professional in Web Accessibility (CPWA) is administered by IAAP. 

It has two parts and two exams:
1. Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies (CPACC)
2. Web Accessibility Specialist (WAS)

You can one or both exams. While there is no requirement that you take the CPACC before the WAS, it's highly recommended. The IAAP publishes official documents called "Body of Knowledge" for each exam. Links to the two body of knowledge pdfs are included in their respective sections below. 
#### The Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies (CPACC)

The Certified Professional in Accessibility (CPACC) is the core foundation of all three professional accessibility certifications that the IAAP offers. 
1. [Certified Professional in Web Accessibility (CPWA)](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/certified-professional-web-accessibility)
2. [Accessible Document Specialist (ADS)](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/accessible-document-specialist)
3. [Certified Professional in Accessible Built Environments (CPABE)](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/certified-professional-environments)

The body of knowledge and exam covers:
- Disabilities, challenges, and assistive technologies
- Models of disability
- Principals of universal design
- International, national, and regional (eg. Ontario) accessibility related laws and standards
#### How to Prepare for the CPACC Exam

The [CPACC body of knowledge](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/resource/IAAP_CPACC_BOK_March2020)contains the majority of the information needed to pass the CPACC. You will also need to look up several of the laws and standards listed in the body of knowledge to gain a greater understanding of them and how they connect. If you don't have personal and/or professional experience with disabled people I recommend:

1. Watching videos produced by [Deque](https://deque.com), 
2. Disabled YouTubers. Here's a handful to get you started:
	- Jessica Kellgren-Fozard [@ Jessica Out of The Closet](https://www.youtube.com/@jessicaoutofthecloset)
	-  [Jessica @ How to ADHD](https://www.youtube.com/@HowtoADHD) - A different Jessica than the one above!
	- Jen from [@ Momming with Migraine](https://www.youtube.com/@MommingwithMigraine)
		- Jen is a service dog handlers
	- Gem Hubbard [@ Wheels no Heels](https://www.youtube.com/@Wheelsnoheels)

	- Richard [@ Wheels 2 Walking ](https://www.youtube.com/@Wheels2Walking)]
3. Reading some of the books on the [Accessibility Book Club list](https://www.zenythgroup.com/book-list)) , and/or 
4. following disabled, neurodiverse, and deaf/Deaf accessibility professionals and advocates on LinkedIn

### Section 508 Trusted Tester

The 508 Trusted Tester accessibility certification is administered by United States Department of Homeland Security. It's broader than the CPWA and includes document accessibility as well as web accessibility.  Though it's American specific, and not as commonly asked for on job postings, there's still some advantages to taking the Trusted Tester exam over the CPWA:

- Both the exam and the preparation materials are free
- It demonstrates to employers that you have a wide range of accessibility skills.
- If you're in the US, looking for a remote job with a US company, or work for a company that has US clients it will give you an advantage over people that don't have certification

The Department of Homeland Security has a [Section 508 trusted tester certification pdf fact sheet]([Trusted Tester Program Fact Sheet (dhs.gov)](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Trusted_Tester_Fact_Sheet_0.pdf)) about
