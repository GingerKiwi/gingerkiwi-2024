Web Accessibility Wednesday - Bonus Friday Edition!

Just now in [James Q Quick](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)'s Learn Build Teach Discord, [Arkar Myat](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) said he'd like some Web Accessibility resources both general and image specific, so I thought I'd do a post to help others as well.

It's not an exhaustive list! I also haven't given summaries like I usually do. It's more like my dumping my current **#A11y** brain cache.

Also check out the profiles and blogs of the people and organizations that I've @ Mentioned. They're also great resources.

  

Hopefully this helps Arkar with his **#Svelte** task and others with their accessibility learning.
