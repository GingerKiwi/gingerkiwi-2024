description: Earlier this month I started the long overdue process of combining my .dev and .blog sites into one full-stack site with improved accessibility, collections, and reader features. During a 4 hour "Group Debugging Party" on the Creatures.dev discord today, the issues caused by updates to drizzle were solved.

The new combined blog and portfolio site is being built in public. 🛠️

Today (Saturday, November 25th), I spent 4 hours today in a "debugging party" with [Lazar Nikolov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikolovlazar/), [Marco Campos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/madcampos/), [Sami Xie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sami-xie-91bb4814a/), and [Paul Valladares](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-valladares/) on Lazar's [Creatures.dev](http://creatures.dev/) [Discord](https://www.linkedin.com/company/discord/) debugging errors with my and other devs Astro + Drizzle ORM + BetterSQLite apps. 🥳  
  
**Issue:** The SQLite library (better-sqlite3) doesn't work well with urls and absolute paths on some node version. So issue with paths, node version and urls, ...  

Lazar's comment: 

> "_We solved a pretty nasty bug to be honest. Nothing pointed towards the format of the db file path. Great job everyone!_ 👏"

Paul:
>"_We became node wizards_ 😂"
  
✅ Solved! Lazar created an update to his awesome course on [egghead.io](https://www.linkedin.com/company/egghead.io/). 
Not sure if it's live yet.  
  
It's way more fun debugging with other devs!  
  
If you're a fellow dev looking for community come and join [TorontoJS](https://www.linkedin.com/company/torontojs/)'s Slack, in person, and online events! [www.torontojs.com](http://www.torontojs.com/).   
It's how I met everyone from today.  
Also [Creatures.dev](http://creatures.dev/) discord has awesome people!  
  
I still have to go back through, tweak a few things, and redeploy. Frontend only version is at: [https://gingerkiwi.xyz](https://gingerkiwi.xyz/).   
But off to go skating! ⛸️The rinks are open!  
  
Migrating my .dev domain to a new registrar should be done by Tuesday.
