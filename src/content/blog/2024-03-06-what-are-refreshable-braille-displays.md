As developers screen readers are the most frequent alternative input/output (i/o) method mentioned when discussing accessibility (a11y). However, there's far more to web accessibility than screen readers. Can you imagine trying to refer to documentation during a meeting by listening to it? You'd miss most of what is being said in the meeting. For those of us that are sighted, we can just choose to read text. For people who are blind and low vision one option is refreshable braille displays. Keep reading to learn more about braille, and refreshable braille displays from a developer's perspective. As always there's a list of resources at the end.
