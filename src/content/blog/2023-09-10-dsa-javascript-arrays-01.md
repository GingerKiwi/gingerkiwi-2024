## About This Article Series

I've been preparing for technical interviews and DSA challenges lately. But it can be so dry! I mean I love a puzzle, but I've found that I prefer solving puzzles that result in an actual project people can use. To keep things interesting, I've been making my own notes with pet and Alice in Wonderland themes. So here's the first of (likely) many DSA articles in Javascript with no foo or bar.

The focus is also on ES6 Javascript to keep things current and just easier to read. I'm assuming that readers will have the basics of programming in Javascript or another language, though I do give a quick overview and some definitions. This is intended as a reference for other devs who are practicing for technical interviews, or want a more fun reference for Javascript programming.

For example a list of songs could have the name "playlist". In this array, all the names of songs are strings.
