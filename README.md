This is my new combined blog and developer portfolio site. It's developed in Astro with Next.js, Drizzle ORM, Better SQLite, and hosted on Fly.io. The starting point was Lazar's Egghead.io Astro course. I've customized the theme, and added some pages and more accessibility features. It's a work in progress, with the next steps being to clean up the css, fix the layouts, add cover images to articles, and move all my articles from https://gingerkiwi.blog over.

Custom domain https://gingerkiwi.dev was added Tuesday, November 28th, 2023.
Obsidian vault for markdown files was created Tuesday, November 28th, 2023.
